SONIC LEVEL MAKER
EVERYTHING RIP
-------------------------------

1) CREDITS
The sprites and tiles contained within were originally created by
SEGA and Sonic Team.
The rip was created by Techokami.

If you use the contents of this package, you must give credit

then you should immediately start yelling at the webmaster for

PROTIP: If you ask first, I'll almost always say yes!

2) THE RIPPING PROCESS
PlaySEGA's Sonic Level Maker was this flash-based thinger that
loaded assets via external files. Using the greatest (at the time)
technology in ad blocking - AdBlock - I was able to intercept all
the requests for external assets and save them locally to my computer.

The conversion of the level chunks into images for the unique tileset
provided in this game was done with a highly modified version of my
Sonic 1/2/3K chunk ripper. It was a pain in the arse. That version
appears to be lost... but generally, it's using the same data formats
as Sonic 1.

3) EXPLANATION OF ARCHIVES
There are three versions of this archive: one that has everything, one
that only has the audio files, and one that has everything but the
audio files. This is because tSR and tSR. No, those two aren't the same
site. Also I'm lazy and don't feel like making multiple readme files.
